What are Network Codes?
Network codes are a set of rules drafted by ENTSO-E, with guidance from the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), to facilitate the harmonisation, integration and efficiency of the European electricity market. Each network code is an integral part of the drive towards completion of the internal energy market, and achieving the European Unionâ€™s energy objectives of:

at least 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels.
at least a 32% share of renewable energy consumption.
at least 32.5% energy savings compared with the business-as-usual
  
  
  
  
  Demand Connection Code
The Demand Connection Code sets harmonised requirements for connecting large renewable energy production plants as well as demand response facilities. The code will ease the integration of 260 gigawatts of photovoltaic & wind (almost tripling the current installed capacity in Europe) as well as 11 gigawatts of demand response in Europe (which could mean the sparing of 11 coal generation plants).
